This is the source of [All the Popped Balloons](https://houkanshan.itch.io/all-the-popped-balloons).

I deleted:

- a paid unity assets [Hierarchy PRO](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/hierarchy-pro-auto-highlighter-89542), so if you want to compile the unity project, you'll need to buy and import it in the project.
- a font [Zpix](https://github.com/SolidZORO/zpix-pixel-font). If you want to change the chinese text, you'll need to download it and put it under /Assets/Fonts/Cn/Zpix.ttf
